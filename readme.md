    - Quality selection (Auto, 480p, 720p, 1080p)
    - Fullscreen mode with gesture support
    - Detailed stream statistics
    - Touch controls for remote interaction
  - Settings view (⏱️ Planned)
- Testing (✅ Completed)
  - Comprehensive test suite for models
  - Mocks for CloudKit and network operations
  - Proper test isolation using dependency injection
  - Robust synchronous testing approach for async operations

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later (for macOS app)
- iOS 17.0 or later (for iOS client)
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 6.0.3 or later

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use macOS app:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Access HLS stream at the configured URL

3. Launch and use iOS client:
   - Grant necessary CloudKit permissions when prompted
   - Discover available devices on the same iCloud account
   - Connect to a streaming device
   - View the streamed content
   - Adjust quality settings as needed for your network
   - Use touch controls to interact with remote content
