- iOS client app for stream playback

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Access HLS stream at the configured URL

## Development

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 70+ tests across all components:
  - HLS streaming and segment management
  - H.264 video encoding
  - Frame processing
  - Screen capture
  - HTTP server and HLS integration
  - Admin dashboard functionality
  - Authentication and security
  - Run tests: `swift test`

### Feature Highlights

#### HLS Features
- Configurable segment duration and playlist length
- Automatic segment rotation and cleanup
