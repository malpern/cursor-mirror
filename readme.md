# CursorWindow

A macOS application for capturing and streaming screen content with HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) support.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed Features**
- Screen capture with customizable viewport
  - Draggable viewport with iPhone 15 Pro dimensions (393x852 pixels)
  - Keyboard shortcuts and menu controls
  - Works across all spaces and full-screen apps
- Real-time H.264 video encoding
  - Thread-safe frame processing
  - Configurable frame rate and bitrate
  - Memory-safe frame management
  - Robust error handling and validation
  - Comprehensive test coverage
- HLS streaming implementation
  - MPEG-TS segment generation with proper timing
  - M3U8 playlist management (Master, Media, Event, VOD)
  - Efficient segment rotation and cleanup
  - Variant stream support
  - Async/await support for thread safety
  - Improved segment timing accuracy

ðŸš§ **In Progress**
- Local HTTP server for stream distribution
- iOS client app for stream playback

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Access HLS stream at the configured URL

## Development

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 44 tests across all components:
  - HLS streaming and segment management (12 tests)
  - H.264 video encoding (6 tests)
    - Basic encoding validation
    - Error handling and edge cases
    - Memory management
    - Concurrent processing
    - Performance benchmarks
  - Frame processing (6 tests)
  - Screen capture (2 tests)
  - Playlist generation (5 tests)
  - UI components (12 tests, requires GUI)
- Run tests: `swift test`

Note: UI tests require a GUI environment and will be skipped when running headless.

### HLS Features
- Configurable segment duration and playlist length
- Automatic segment rotation and cleanup
- Support for multiple variant streams
- Event and VOD playlist generation
- Base URL configuration for flexible deployment
- Improved segment timing accuracy
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

### Performance Features
- Background frame processing
- 60fps UI update throttling
- Metal-accelerated rendering
- Debounced controls
- Proper task cancellation
- Efficient segment management
- Memory-optimized frame handling
- Thread-safe video encoding
