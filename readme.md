## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Access HLS stream at the configured URL

## Development

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 59 tests across all components:
  - HLS streaming and segment management (12 tests)
  - H.264 video encoding (6 tests)
    - Basic encoding validation
    - Error handling and edge cases
    - Memory management
    - Concurrent processing
    - Performance benchmarks
  - Frame processing (6 tests)
  - Screen capture (2 tests)

### Admin Dashboard Features

The admin dashboard provides a web-based interface for managing and monitoring the HTTP server. Key features include:

- **Dashboard Overview**: Real-time monitoring of server status, stream connections, and request traffic
- **Stream Management**: Monitor active streams, view connection history, and manage stream timeouts
- **Settings Management**: Configure all server settings through a user-friendly interface
- **Logs Viewer**: Browse, filter, and export server logs
- **Authentication**: Login protection for admin access
