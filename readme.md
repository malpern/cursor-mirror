## iOS Client App Development Plan

The iOS client app will serve as a simple viewer application for CursorWindow streams, limited to a single viewer connection at a time.

### Core Requirements
- Create a minimalist SwiftUI-based iOS app with iOS 17+ target
- Implement HLS stream player using AVPlayer 
- Support single concurrent connection (enforce on server side)
- Focus on reliable, stable playback with minimal latency
- Use iCloud for seamless device discovery and authentication

### Implementation Plan
1. **iCloud Integration & Device Discovery**
   - Authenticate with iCloud account (same account on macOS and iOS)
   - Automatic discovery of available CursorWindow instances on user's devices
   - No manual URL entry or QR code scanning required
   - Simple device selection if multiple sources are available
   - Background synchronization of connection details

2. **Playback Functionality**
   - Full-screen video player with native controls
   - Stream quality/resolution display
   - Network quality indicator
   - Basic playback controls (play/pause, volume)
   - Portrait and landscape orientation support
   - One-tap connection to available stream

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Simple MVVM with SwiftUI
- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 17.0
- **Key Frameworks**:
  - SwiftUI for UI components
  - AVFoundation/AVKit for video playback
  - CloudKit for iCloud integration and device discovery
  - Network framework for connection management
- **Design Focus**: Zero-configuration experience with minimal user intervention
- **Performance Priority**: Connection reliability and playback stability

The iOS client app will provide a nearly effortless connection experience - just sign in with your iCloud account on both devices, and the connection happens automatically. This eliminates all manual configuration steps, greatly simplifying the user experience.

## Server-Side iCloud Integration (âœ… Completed)

The server component now includes the following CloudKit integration features:

### CloudKit Integration
- CloudKit framework integration for iCloud operations
- `CloudKitManager` class for managing device broadcasting
- Server record type for sharing connection details
- Private CloudKit database for secure communication
- Background refresh for status updates

### Server Identity & Discovery
- Unique server identifier generation and persistence
- Server availability broadcasting via CloudKit
- Automatic network address detection
- Real-time network change monitoring
- Server name customization

### Authentication Enhancements
- Extended `AuthenticationManager` with iCloud support
- `CloudKitAuthMiddleware` for iCloud identity verification
- Single-viewer access control
- Enhanced session management
- Configurable authentication methods

### Network Management
- `NetworkAddressDetector` for automatic IP address discovery
- Support for multiple interfaces and address types
- Public IP detection
- Network path monitoring for connection changes
- Address prioritization for connection reliability

### Security Improvements
- Enhanced error handling with `CloudKitError` type
- Improved session timeout and cleanup
- Structured notification system for status changes
- Entitlements for CloudKit and network capabilities

This integration enables zero-configuration connections between devices using the same iCloud account, eliminating the need for manual URL entry or QR code scanning when using the upcoming iOS client app.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- iCloud account (for CloudKit features)

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Use Server tab to start the HTTP server and get stream access
   - Access HLS stream at the provided URL or scan the QR code with a mobile device
   - For iCloud discovery, ensure you're signed into the same iCloud account on both devices
