## iOS Client App Development Plan

The iOS client app will serve as a simple viewer application for CursorWindow streams, limited to a single viewer connection at a time.

### Core Requirements
- Create a minimalist SwiftUI-based iOS app with iOS 17+ target
- Implement HLS stream player using AVPlayer 
- Support single concurrent connection (enforce on server side)
- Focus on reliable, stable playback with minimal latency

### Implementation Plan
1. **Basic Setup & Connection**
   - Stream URL input (manual entry)
   - QR code scanner for quick connection
   - Connection status indicator
   - Simple error handling with clear user feedback

2. **Playback Functionality**
   - Full-screen video player with native controls
   - Stream quality/resolution display
   - Network quality indicator
   - Basic playback controls (play/pause, volume)
   - Portrait and landscape orientation support

3. **Optional Enhancements** (if time allows)
   - Saved connections (remember recent URLs)
   - Picture-in-Picture support
   - Background audio playback
   - Stream authentication support (for password-protected streams)
   - Simple network diagnostics

### Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: Simple MVVM with SwiftUI
- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 17.0
- **Key Frameworks**:
  - SwiftUI for UI components
  - AVFoundation/AVKit for video playback
  - Vision for QR code scanning
- **Design Focus**: Minimalist interface with clear feedback
- **Performance Priority**: Connection reliability and playback stability

The iOS client app will be a relatively straightforward implementation compared to the server components, focused on reliable playback rather than extensive features.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

## Quick Start

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-window.git
cd cursor-window
swift build
```

2. Launch and use:
   - Grant screen recording permission when prompted
   - Use Preview tab to position capture viewport
   - Use Encoding tab to configure and start streaming
   - Use Server tab to start the HTTP server and get stream access
   - Access HLS stream at the provided URL or scan the QR code with a mobile device
